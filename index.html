I have been developing software for 9 years already. After graduating in computer science from Moscow State University, I worked as a developer in a small startup specializing in computer vision for about 4 years. Then I grew up to Senior NET Developer at the largest telecom operator in Russia - MTS, where I worked on a project, that allow developers and businesses to monitor and troubleshoot interactions between complex distributed systems. Almost two years ago I moved to Armenia and work at EPAM, where I am developing an alternative financial platform for one of the large clients in a distributed team. I enjoy solving complex problems and helping other developers and customers create and deliver quality solutions. I have deep experience at all stages of the software development life cycle. Now I am open to any opportunities and interesting projects!"/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/portfolio/manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="/portfolio/social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="/portfolio/social-image.png"/><title>Vitaly Kvashin</title><script defer="defer" src="/portfolio/static/js/main.7a3f7351.js"></script><link href="/portfolio/static/css/main.626c3b40.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
