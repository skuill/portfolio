      content="My name is Vitaly Kvashin. I have been developing software for 9 years already. After graduating in computer science from Moscow State University, I worked as a developer in a small startup specializing in computer vision for about 4 years. Then I grew up to Senior NET Developer at the largest telecom operator in Russia - MTS, where I worked on a project, that allow developers and businesses to monitor and troubleshoot interactions between complex distributed systems. Almost two years ago I moved to Armenia and work at EPAM, where I am developing an alternative financial platform for one of the large clients in a distributed team. I enjoy solving complex problems and helping other developers and customers create and deliver quality solutions. I have deep experience at all stages of the software development life cycle. Now I am open to any opportunities and interesting projects!"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
